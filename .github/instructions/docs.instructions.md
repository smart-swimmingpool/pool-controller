# Documentation Guidelines

- Use consistent titles and structured sections for all documentation.
- Include examples and code snippets that follow project coding style.
- Do not include duplication of standards that exist in `AGENTS.md`; refer to them where possible.
- Documentation changes must be accompanied by test updates where relevant.
- Ensure all documentation is clear, concise, and free of jargon.
